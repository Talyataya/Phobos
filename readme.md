Phobos
====

Phobos is an open-source mod aimed to expand Zeus capabilities by taking Ares as a core. The objective of Phobos is to provide extra functionalities as well as speed up the process in mission making for users without any dependence on other clients or server running extra mods.

It currently is not recommended for 'public server' play as some of features may be abused.

## Requirements:

* Ares Mod or any mod that contains Ares functions(Such as Achilles).
```
Warning: Phobos is designed to prevent users from launching the game with Phobos, 
if required function source is not found, to avoid unexpected behaviors.
